I made this class in completing 'Professional Portfolio Project - [lorem ipsum], Assigment 4: lorem ipsum' from:

### Assignment: Tic Tac Toe

#### _Build a text-based version of the Tic Tac Toe game._

Using what you have learnt about Python programming:

- Build a text-based version of the Tic Tac Toe game.
- The game should be playable in the command-line just like the Blackjack game we created on Day 11.
- It should be a 2-player game, where one person is "X" and the other plays "O".

This is a simple demonstration of how the game works:

You can choose how you want your game to look. The simplest is to create a game board using "|" and "_" symbols. But the
design is up to you.

If you have more time, you can challenge yourself to build an AI player to play the game with you.
